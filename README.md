# simreporter
 half-sentient video editor

A race against myself until the computer beats me at editing a series of videos I started here:

Some of them will be generated, some will be 'hand' made by me. 
The idea is to get to the point were they look the same and I'm gonna longer involved in the process.

I need to dwelve deep into AI and ML and I'm far from that; 
in the meantime, I'll make myself some helpers for time consuming tasks!

# PexelPusher:

Using Pexel's API and a series of queries for searching videos, it grabs thumbnails to make a contact sheet. 
Once you're happy with the result, you can download the videos in a folder, with each name as video_id and a credit list with proper attributions.

# Montaner: 

Makes a contactsheet based on a video folder. If useful, I'll promote it to module for my banana stand.

# Mr.PMosh:

Using do_the_mosh.py as a base (from this repository: %) it will datamosh the videos in a folder using json files as preconfigured attributes, some will be set dinamically using video's info (relative duration).

# AnalAudio:

An audio tool to analize a given song and extract data to use for editing

# StBiasati:

A tool to generate texts for rendering

# SimReporter:

This will use all or some of the above to build a full video, edited and with generated supers. Ideally wrapped around PyGame (or even Electron further down the line)
